# MCTS-Checkers
Simple implementation of MCTS in checkers

The files attached work, but it's very slow mainly because the SQL table is very ugly and uses a large string (of the checkers board) as the primary key

This project is my first on Github, and it is my senior capstone for Shenandoah Valley Governor's School.
